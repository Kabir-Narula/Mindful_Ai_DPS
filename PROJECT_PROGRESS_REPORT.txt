WHAT YOUR GROUP HAS ACCOMPLISHED THUS FAR
================================================================================

I have successfully built a complete, working mental wellbeing and journaling 
application called MindfulAI from scratch. The application includes a secure 
authentication system where I implemented JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only 
cookies. In my signup API route (`app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`), I validate 
email format using regex patterns, ensure passwords are at least 8 characters, 
hash passwords using bcrypt, and store user data in PostgreSQL. When users create 
journal entries, my API route (`app/api/journal/route.ts`) validates the title 
(must be under 200 characters), content (under 10,000 characters), and mood 
rating (must be between 1-10). Every journal entry automatically triggers AI 
sentiment analysis using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model through my `analyzeSentiment` 
function in `lib/openai.ts`, which returns a sentiment score from -1 to 1, a 
label (positive/neutral/negative), and personalized feedback. I also implemented 
a comprehensive database schema using Prisma ORM with models for Users, 
JournalEntries, MoodEntries, Goals, GoalCheckIns, ChatSessions, and ChatMessages, 
all properly indexed for performance. The dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`) 
calculates statistics like total journals, journaling streaks by checking 
consecutive days with entries, and average mood scores from mood entries. I built 
an AI chat companion that creates separate chat sessions, allows users to discuss 
specific journal entries, and maintains conversation history. The chat API 
(`app/api/chat/route.ts`) fetches the user's recent moods and journal entries to 
provide context-aware responses. I also implemented goal tracking where users can 
create goals with target dates and check in on their progress. The entire 
application has a modern, professional UI built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, 
Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components, with full-screen layouts, smooth animations, 
and responsive design that works on all devices. All API routes include proper 
error handling, input validation, timeout protection (10 seconds for sentiment 
analysis, 30 seconds for chat responses), and pagination support for journal 
entries. The application is fully functional and production-ready.

WHAT TASKS YOUR GROUP WILL WORK ON THIS WEEK
================================================================================

This week I plan to add search and filter functionality to the journal page. 
Currently, users can only see their entries in chronological order, but as they 
accumulate more entries, finding specific ones becomes difficult. I will add a 
search bar that queries the journal entry title and content fields in the database, 
similar to how I currently fetch entries in `app/api/journal/route.ts` but with 
additional WHERE clauses for text matching. I'll also add filter options for date 
ranges (using Prisma's date range queries like `createdAt: { gte: startDate, lte: 
endDate }`), mood ratings (filtering by the `moodRating` field), sentiment labels 
(using the `sentimentLabel` field I already store), and activities (filtering by 
the `activities` array field). I'll add sorting options similar to the existing 
`orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }` but with additional options like mood high to 
low. I'm also going to implement quick mood logging - a floating action button on 
the dashboard that opens a modal where users can quickly rate their mood from 1-10 
without writing a full journal entry. This will create a MoodEntry record directly 
using the existing `prisma.moodEntry.create()` pattern, which will help collect 
more mood data throughout the day. Additionally, I want to build mood pattern 
analysis that will query the database to find correlations between activities and 
mood scores. For example, I'll write queries that group entries by activities and 
calculate average mood scores, then identify patterns like "Your mood improves by 
20% on days when you exercise" by comparing mood scores for entries with 
"Exercise" in the activities array versus those without. I'll also analyze time 
of day patterns by grouping mood entries by hour of creation, and day of week 
patterns by grouping by day name. These insights will be displayed in a new 
"Patterns" section on the dashboard. I'll also polish the UI, improve form 
validation with real-time feedback (similar to the validation I already have in 
the signup route), add better loading states using skeleton components, and 
thoroughly test all features to ensure everything works smoothly.

REVISED PLAN - WHY WE CHANGED FROM THE ORIGINAL PLAN
================================================================================

My original plan was to build the frontend with React and Vite, create a separate 
Python backend using FastAPI, and use Python libraries like spaCy, NLTK, and VADER 
to build my own sentiment analysis system. However, I changed to using Next.js 14 
for both frontend and backend, and OpenAI's API for AI features instead. The main 
reason is that Next.js lets me write everything in one codebase using TypeScript, 
which is much simpler than managing two separate projects. For example, my journal 
API route at `app/api/journal/route.ts` is in the same codebase as my dashboard 
page at `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, so I can share types and utilities easily. 
Instead of setting up a separate Python server, CORS configuration, and API 
gateway, I just create API route files in the `app/api` directory and they work 
automatically. This made development faster because I didn't need to configure 
communication between frontend and backend - it's all in one place. Using OpenAI's 
API instead of building my own NLP system gives me much better results. In my 
`lib/openai.ts` file, I use GPT-3.5-turbo which understands context and provides 
empathetic responses. For example, in my `analyzeSentiment` function, the AI 
analyzes the full journal entry content and title together, not just keywords, 
which gives more accurate sentiment scores. In my `getChatResponse` function, 
the AI receives context about the user's recent moods, journal entries, and even 
specific journal entries they want to discuss, allowing for much more helpful, 
contextual responses than basic keyword matching with VADER would provide. I kept 
all the important parts from the original plan - I still use PostgreSQL (as seen 
in my `prisma/schema.prisma` file), JWT authentication (implemented in `lib/auth.ts` 
and used in all API routes), mood tracking (stored in the MoodEntry model), and 
goal features (Goal and GoalCheckIn models). I just built them in a simpler, more 
modern way using Next.js API routes instead of FastAPI, Prisma ORM instead of 
SQLAlchemy, and OpenAI instead of custom NLP pipelines. This approach is more 
practical for a course project timeline since I can focus on building features 
instead of complex AI infrastructure, and the results are actually better because 
OpenAI's models are more advanced than basic NLP libraries.
